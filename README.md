# HTML Boilerplate

This is just a thing that I made from sage, to gain some
time when building simple web application, like just Landing Paged etc. This boilerplate comes with a really nice configured **gulpfile.js** that I got from [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/), that will speed up your development and better organize your assets files.


To download it, just do:

> git clone https://github.com/cesarhgd10/html-boilerplate.git


or

> create a folder *myapp*
>
> cd *myapp*
>
> git init
>
> git remote add origin https://github.com/cesarhgd10/html-boilerplate.git
>
> git pull origin master

After your download it, you'll need to run *npn install* and *bower install* to install all dependencies.
